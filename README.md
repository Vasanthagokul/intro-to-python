# Introduction to Python & Computational Thinking
## Self-Paced Lab Session (3-4 Hours)

Welcome! This repository contains hands-on Jupyter notebooks to help you learn Python fundamentals through practical exercises.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
By the end of this session, you will:
- Understand Python basics and write clean code
- Apply computational thinking to solve problems
- Use variables, data types, and control flow effectively
- Work with functions and data structures
- Read/write files and process data
- Debug common errors confidently

## 📚 Lab Structure

### Part 1: Foundations (60-70 minutes)
1. **[01_Python_Basics.ipynb](01_Python_Basics.ipynb)** - Variables, data types, operators
2. **[02_Control_Flow.ipynb](02_Control_Flow.ipynb)** - If/elif/else, loops, break/continue

### Part 2: Building Blocks (60-70 minutes)
3. **[03_Functions.ipynb](03_Functions.ipynb)** - Defining functions, parameters, return values
4. **[04_Data_Structures.ipynb](04_Data_Structures.ipynb)** - Lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets

### Part 3: Practical Applications (50-60 minutes)
5. **[05_File_Operations.ipynb](05_File_Operations.ipynb)** - Reading/writing files, processing data
6. **[06_String_Processing.ipynb](06_String_Processing.ipynb)** - String methods, formatting, manipulation

### Part 4: Challenge Problems (40-50 minutes)
7. **[07_Practice_Problems.ipynb](07_Practice_Problems.ipynb)** - Easy to medium exercises
8. **[08_Advanced_Challenges.ipynb](08_Advanced_Challenges.ipynb)** - 2 harder problems to stretch your skills

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ installed
- Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab
- Basic understanding of what programming is

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vasanthagokul/python-intro-labs
   cd python-intro-labs/intro-to-python
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On Mac/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Jupyter:**
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter
   ```

4. **Start Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. **Open the notebooks** in order (01, 02, 03...) and follow along!

## 📝 How to Use This Repository

- **Work sequentially** - Start with notebook 01 and progress through
- **Run all code cells** - Type `Shift + Enter` to execute cells
- **Experiment freely** - Modify code, try variations, break things!
- **Complete exercises** - Each notebook has practice problems
- **Ask questions** - Don't hesitate to raise your hand during the session

## 💡 Tips for Success

1. **Read explanations carefully** before running code
2. **Type code yourself** instead of copy-pasting (builds muscle memory)
3. **Test your understanding** by modifying examples
4. **Debug actively** - errors are learning opportunities
5. **Take breaks** - Stand up, stretch every 45-60 minutes

## 🆘 Getting Help

- Check the **Solutions** section at the end of each notebook
- Refer to comments and explanations in code cells
- Use `help(function_name)` in Python for documentation
- Raise your hand during the lab session
- Create an issue in this repo for questions
